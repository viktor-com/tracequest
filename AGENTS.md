## Fact-driven development

This project uses [facts](https://github.com/av/facts) for specification and documentation. All work flows through the fact sheet — it is the source of truth.

**Every change starts with a fact.** Facts are the spec — they define what "done" means. Code that isn't described by a fact is unverifiable and will be treated as incorrect. The skill `facts skills show facts` has the full format spec and command reference.

1. `facts list` — read the current spec to orient. Fact sheets can be large — use filters to focus: `--section "cli/init"`, `--tags "draft"`, `--file api.facts`, `--manual`. Read only the section relevant to your task, not the entire sheet.
2. `facts add` — write facts describing what should be true when done. Each fact is a testable claim. You are not ready to write code until this step is complete.
3. Implement the code to make those facts true
4. `facts check --tags "<tag>"` or `facts get <id>` — verify your changes. Never run bare `facts check` unless asked.
5. `facts edit <id> --add-tag implemented` — mark verified facts done

Step 4 only works if step 2 happened. If you skipped step 2, go back now — you cannot verify work that has no fact.

**Manual facts (`?` in check output):** these have no command, so you verify them by reading the relevant code. For each `?` fact: read what it claims, check the code, report PASS or FAIL with a one-line reason. Reporting "N manual" without verifying each one is not acceptable.

**Lifecycle:** `@draft` → `@spec` → `@implemented`

**Domain:** the `## domain` section in `.facts` defines the project's entities and relations — read it first to learn the vocabulary.

**Skills** (invoke via `facts skills show <name>`):
- `facts-refine` — sharpen `@draft` facts into `@spec` with the user
- `facts-discover` — scan the codebase and sync facts to reality (only when explicitly asked)
- `facts-implement` — implement `@spec` facts in code, verify, tag `@implemented`

Indexing and search performance tests combine **single-file filler micro-benchmarks** (hot-path skip/parse) with a **shared ~3000-session pipeline corpus** (`test/sessions/index-search-pipeline-perf.test.js`). Never run 32k separate files or bulk SQLite inserts per test. Hot-path indexer perf: `session-index-jsonl.test.js`, `scan-queries.test.js`, parse `*(perf)*` tests. Rust batch: `cargo test test_build_index_synthetic_claude_batch_perf`.
